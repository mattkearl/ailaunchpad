# AI Project Helper: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Elevator Pitch
AI Project Helper is a streamlined, static website that provides high school students with ready-to-use AI prompts to develop their app or website ideas. Students can copy these structured prompts into AI tools to generate professional documents including Product Requirements Documents, User Interface designs, and Software Requirement Specificationsâ€”turning their ideas into well-defined projects without technical expertise.

## 2. Who is this app for
### Primary Target Audience
- High school students (grades 9-12) interested in technology and app/website development
- Students with creative ideas but limited technical experience in software development

### Secondary Audiences
- Technology or entrepreneurship teachers who want to provide students with practical tools
- STEM program coordinators looking for project-based learning resources
- Young creators who want to leverage AI tools to bring their ideas to life

### User Personas
- **Innovative Isha (16)**: Has creative ideas but doesn't know how to transform them into technical specifications
- **Teacher Tom (42)**: Wants to guide students through the software development process but needs structured resources
- **Hackathon Harry (17)**: Needs to quickly develop project documentation for a weekend coding competition

## 3. Problem Statement
High school students with innovative app and website ideas often lack the technical knowledge to properly document and specify their concepts in a way that developers (or AI tools) can understand and implement. Traditional software development documentation is complex and filled with industry jargon, creating a significant barrier to entry for young innovators wanting to bring their ideas to life.
