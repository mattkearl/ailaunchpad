# Product Requirements Document: AI Launchpad

## 1. Elevator Pitch
AI Launchpad is a website designed for high school students with no coding experience to easily create websites, web apps, or games using AI. The site provides a visually engaging scrolling experience that guides students through the process, explains how to effectively use AI tools, and ultimately launches them directly into bolt.new with pre-filled prompts tailored to help them build their ideas without writing a single line of code.

## 2. Who is this app for
This app is specifically designed for high school students with zero coding expertise who want to create digital projects but lack the technical skills to do so. The target audience includes creative students who have ideas but are intimidated by traditional coding, technology enthusiasts who want to experiment with AI tools, and students looking to build simple projects for school or personal use.

## 3. Problem or Purpose
AI Launchpad solves the problem of the technical barrier that prevents many high school students from bringing their creative ideas to life. Traditional coding requires significant time investment and learning, which can discourage students from even attempting to create digital projects. This website bridges that gap by leveraging AI tools to allow students to create functional websites, games, or web applications without writing code, democratizing access to digital creation.
