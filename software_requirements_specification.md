# Software Requirements Specification: AI Launchpad

## Purpose and Scope
This document outlines the technical requirements for the AI Launchpad website, a platform designed to help high school students with no coding experience create websites, web apps, or games using AI. The website will feature a cosmic gradient design with a scrolling interface that guides users through informational screens before redirecting them to bolt.new with pre-filled prompts.

## System Design
The system will be a client-side only web application with no backend processing. It will consist of:
- A single HTML page with multiple sections that appear as separate screens
- CSS for styling the cosmic gradient theme and handling animations
- JavaScript for controlling scroll-based animations and transitions
- URL parameter handling for redirecting to bolt.new with pre-filled prompts

The website will load all content at once and use scroll events to trigger animations and transitions between screens. No data persistence or server-side processing is required.

## Architecture Pattern
The project will follow a simple, modular front-end architecture:
- HTML for content structure using semantic elements
- CSS for styling and basic animations
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements and complex animations
- Event-driven programming for handling user interactions

This approach mirrors the example website (https://natesmith.design/scroll-transform-exploration) with a focus on clean, maintainable code without frameworks.

## State Management
The application will maintain minimal state:
- Current scroll position to determine which screen is active
- Animation states for various elements (visible, hidden, transitioning)
- User interaction states (hover, active) for interactive elements

State will be managed through vanilla JavaScript variables and DOM manipulation, with CSS classes toggled based on scroll position and user interactions.

## Data Flow
1. User loads the website
2. Browser renders the initial view with the hero screen
3. As user scrolls, JavaScript detects scroll position and triggers appropriate animations
4. When specific scroll thresholds are reached, new screens transition into view
5. When the user clicks the "Launch Idea" button, JavaScript constructs the bolt.new URL with pre-filled prompt
6. User is redirected to bolt.new with the appropriate parameters

## Tools & Languages
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for content structure
- **CSS3**: 
  - Custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
  - Animations and transitions for smooth effects
  - Grid and Flexbox for layout
  - Media queries for responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**:
  - Intersection Observer API for scroll-based animations
  - Event listeners for user interactions
  - DOM manipulation for dynamic content changes
- **No frameworks or libraries** required, keeping the implementation simple and lightweight
- **Version control**: Git for code management
- **Deployment**: Any static web hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

## Authentication Process
*Not applicable for this project*

The website does not require user accounts or authentication as it serves as an informational gateway to bolt.new.

## Route Design
This is a single-page application with no traditional routes. Navigation occurs through scrolling:

1. **Hero Screen** (initial view)
   - Scrolling down → Introduction Screen
   
2. **Introduction Screen**
   - Scrolling up → Hero Screen
   - Scrolling down → Process Screen
   
3. **Process Screen**
   - Scrolling up → Introduction Screen
   - Scrolling down → Guidelines Screen
   
4. **Guidelines Screen**
   - Scrolling up → Process Screen
   - Scrolling down → Possibilities Screen
   
5. **Possibilities Screen**
   - Scrolling up → Guidelines Screen
   - Scrolling down → Launch Screen
   
6. **Launch Screen**
   - Scrolling up → Possibilities Screen
   - Clicking "Launch Idea" button → External redirect to bolt.new

## API Design
*Not applicable for this project*

The website does not require any API integrations except for the redirect to bolt.new, which is handled through a simple URL with query parameters:

```
https://bolt.new/?prompt=[encoded_prompt]
```

## Database Design / ERD
*Not applicable for this project*

The website does not require data persistence or database storage. All content is static and loaded with the initial page.

## Constraints and Assumptions
- **Browser Support**: The website will support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) from the last two years
- **Performance**: Animations and transitions will be optimized to run smoothly on mid-range devices
- **Connectivity**: The website requires an internet connection only for initial loading and for redirecting to bolt.new
- **Content**: All text content and visual assets will be embedded in the website with no dynamic content loading
- **Scope**: This is a simple, informational website with no user accounts, data storage, or complex functionality
- **Accessibility**: The website will include options to reduce motion for users with vestibular disorders
- **Maintenance**: The design prioritizes maintainability with clean, well-commented code and minimal dependencies
